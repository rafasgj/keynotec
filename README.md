# KeynoteC

A simple DSL to create keynote presentations using LaTeX and Beamer.

## Usage

At this state, **KeynoteC** is usable, execute it with
`python keynotec.py <filename.key>` to compile the keynote into a PDF file.

## Syntax

For now, use the [keynote.key](keynote.key) file as an example of everything
that is already working.

## Dependencies

**XeLaTeX** is used to generate the PDF output file. Also, the following LaTeX
packages are required:

* beamer
* inputenc
* fontspec
* enumitem
* calc
* datetime
* babel
* listings

## Code Quality

It works. It does what I need. I built everything in about 24h. It was much
less than that in work hours.

And the code shows it. Live with that. I do.

To aid in its development, report any issue you have or enhanmente you want in
the project's [Github repository](https://github.com/rafasgj/keynotec).

Thank you.
